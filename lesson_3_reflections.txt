When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- share project to public (git remote add origin -> git push origin -> everyone can see)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
- better control the version of change
- no unwanted merge and conflict resolution needed
