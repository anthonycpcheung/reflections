When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- share project to public (git remote add origin -> git push origin -> everyone can see)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
- better control the version of change
- no unwanted merge and conflict resolution needed

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Branches = make another version within a Git repository; use when working changes in repository
- Clone = make an exact copy of a Git repository; use when making backup, do completely independent changes
- Fork = make a clone of other's GitHub repository. This function is only found in Git Hub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- to track the different of commits done in local and remote; find out conflicts
